When I started my foray into the world of quantitative finance, I knew literally nothing about finance beyond what was patently obvious based on my minimal understanding of economics and moderate understanding of math. Quant finance is home to a complex and expansive lexicon of terms that often, but not always, have meanings and connotations specific to finance. On occasion these finance-specific definitions are pathological in nature, contradicting the use of the term in other disciplines or even fundamental notions of common sense. This was enough of a problem for me that I needed a crash course in financial terminology before my first hedge fund interview (thankfully, my ignorance was nothing that couldn't be fixed with a deck of flash cards and a couple cups of coffee).

Given this, I think it might be a good idea to provide some basic information regarding things that are fundamental to quantitative researchers and financial professionals. Rather than scatter this information about the site whenever it becomes necessary, I've elected to create this post as a repository of such definitions and descriptions. Ideally this post will provide a jumping-off point for exploration of various financial topics, and will hopefully aid those fortunate enough to have until this point avoided the world of institutional finance altogether (hi, mom). I can make no claims for the general accuracy of the terminology provided here other than that, when I refer to these terms, I'll be careful to refer to them in the same sense as they are provided here. That said, most of the following *should* generalize to quantitative finance as a whole.

First, a side note: [Investopedia][investopedia] provides a rather good resource for the description of various financial instruments and financial jargon. I certainly recommend a look around if you find yourself wondering what makes an [iron butterfly][ironbutterfly] different from an [iron condor][ironcondor] or curious what sort of [exotic options][exoticoptions] are available off the market. That said, my goal here *is not* to compete with investopedia as an encyclopedia of finance terms. Rather, I'd like to try to develop a holistic understanding of more fundamental ideas in finance from first principles,ideally with some math and examples to help motivate understanding of these topics. The ultimate goal is to approach things like risk and performance carefully enough that a total beginner isn't intimidated, but a professional analyst still walks away with something to think about.
