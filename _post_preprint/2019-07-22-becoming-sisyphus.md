Success is complicated. When we try to say how successful we think a person is, we're trying to take that person's entire life and collapse it into a number that we can use to compare them on a scale. The variety in functions one could come up with is absolutely mind-boggling. Moreover, determining which parts of a person's success came from decisions (that we can ostensibly credit them for) and which came from luck or preexisting circumstances is an even more fearsome problem. This post is not about any such things. 

Rather than trying to define success and then build a system with which one can achieve it, I just want to share some principles that have been useful to me so far. Overall, I've been extremely fortunate when it comes to most external circumstances and rather unfortunate when it comes to a couple others. I don't have a **system**. If you put me at the beginning of my life (or even 5 years ago) I might not even be able to replicate what got me here.

Starting anything is hard. Usually it's the hardest part of doing a task that takes longer than a moment to complete, or at least in the top 3 hardest parts. This is especially true if you happen to be an expert procrastinator and also a busy person: god forbid the thing is also something that you *want* to do but not that you *need* to do, because then your procrastination gremlins<sup>1</sup> will ensure that any moment of inspiration is immediately crushed under an unwanted enumeration of all of the more important things on your to-do list. Other people have written about procrastination, though. There is a fantastic (illustrated!) procrastination series on [wait but why](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html) that honestly does the topic far more justice than I think I could. 

Instead, I want to rant about something different: illness. Not the straightforward kind of illness where you're sick and then you're either not sick or dead, but the kind that sticks around and ruins the maximum amount of your life possible (but still maybe screws with your life expectancy too). Unfortunately, I'm not only a procrastinator, but a procrastinator with chronic illness<sup>2</sup>. Disentangling these things is a nightmare, and it's often feels like walking a tightrope bordered on one side by the pit of unjustified self-loathing and on the other by the quagmire of unjustified self-pity. A lot of my journey in life so far (at least, since I started dealing with neurological issues about 7 years ago) has been trying to figure out how to navigate the tightrope. Ideally without warping my internal reality beyond the point of sanity. Perhaps what I have to say applies to other sorts of adversity too. I have absolutely no idea, and I barely feel comfortable talking about my own struggles let alone conjecturing about the struggles of others. I don't intend this as a pity party, either. Overall I've been and extraordinarily lucky and priveleged in many aspects of my life, not to mention supported tirelessly by family and friends. This blog post is about the parts where the universe was a jerk.




### Notes:
1 - procrastination gremlins are closely related to the [instant gratification monkey](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html)

2 - for the curious: currently my symptoms consist of pretty scary loss of motor control at times, depressed reflexes, prehipheral nerve demylination, and really nasty chronic pain. My diagnosis depends on who you ask but a couple different neurologists have suggested MS, which is what my current treatments are assuming
