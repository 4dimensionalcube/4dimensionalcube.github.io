This is 4dimensionalcube, a blog about physics, math, finance, and perhaps some other things. 

4dimensionalcube is the project of Tim Ireland, a guy who spends most of his time reading books and papers about anything that isn't related to whatever he's supposed to be working on. Tim is something of an armchair physicist, having for the time being forsaken academia in favor of a job doing machine learning things for a hedge fund. Alongside articles related to finance he plans on contributing things about general data science, general science science, and perhaps a bit of philosophy and creative work. Realistically, he'll be writing mostly about random topics that happen to cross him when he has both the time and attention span to hammer out a full post plus the good sense to put it on the internet before he convinces himself that it is rubbish. 

Questions, comments, plans for perpetual motion machines, and hate-mail (the latter two options being similar in function if not in content) can be directed to 4dimensionalcube@gmail.com. If you find a mistake in something here, by all means point it out! It will be corrected or made note of post-haste, and if desired your name or an appropriate psuedonym will be included in the annotation. Of course, you're always welcome to head to the comments section and say mean things about the author instead if that's what makes you happy. 

**Obligatory disclaimer:** Tim is in posession of exactly zero licences to provide personal financial advice (in jurisdictions where such licences are required). Anything you find here with regards to finance (and most other things) constitutes little more than Tim's opinion, unless it is directly or indirectly quoted from some other source. Please, consult resources more robust than some random person on the internet before making important financial decisions.

One more note: this site uses a somewhat modified version of the Jekyll theme 'Moon' by Taylan TatlÄ±. If you like it, definitely check it out [here](http://taylantatli.github.io/Moon/) and be sure to star it on github!
