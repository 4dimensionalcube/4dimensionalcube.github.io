Welcome to 4dimensionalcube, a blog about physics, math, finance, and perhaps a number of other things. 

4dimensionalcube is the project of Tim Ireland, a guy who spends most of his time studying physics, math, statistics, and computer science. Tim would like to call himself a physicist but the dark arts of quantitative finance have lured him away from the completion of a PhD (temporarily, he hopes). He started work as a full-time quantitative analyst for a well established hedge fund at age 19 while completing his degrees, and in the handful of years since has developed some insight into the industry that he would like to share. Alongside articles relating to finance he plans on contributing posts about general data science, general science science, and perhaps a bit of philosophy.

Questions, comments, plans for perpetual motion machines, and hate-mail (the latter two options being similar in function if not in content) can be directed to 4dimensionalcube[at]gmail[dot]com. If you find a mistake in something here, by all means point it out! It will be corrected or made note of post-haste, and if desired your name or an appropriate psuedonym will be included in the annotation. 

**Obligatory disclaimer:** Tim is in posession of exactly zero licences to provide personal financial advice (in jurisdictions where such licences are required). Anything you find here with regards to finance (and most other things) constitutes little more than Tim's opinion, unless it is directly or indirectly quoted from some other source. Please, consult resources more robust than some random person on the internet before making important financial decisions.
